# FTO-Sim
**FTO-Sim** is an open-source simulation framework for Floating Traffic Observation (FTO). The FTO concept is adapted from the Floating Car Observer (FCO) method, that utilizes extended floating car data (xFCD) for traffic planning and traffic management purposes. Additionally, this simulation framework introduces further observer vehicle types, such as Floating Bike Observers (FBO).

For this, **FTO-Sim** is connected to a SUMO simulation and customized according to the user's needs. This ReadMe file serves as documentation for **FTO-Sim** and describes the single modules of the simulation framework as well as its customization and initialization.
